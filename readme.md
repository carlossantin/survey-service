Survey Application
==================

The goal of this project is to build a backend solution to perform surveys. This solution is able to run in the cloud.

 The following features are available by REST services:
 
 * Creation of new questions.
 * Opening the vote on a question, with a set duration or one minute by default.
 * Members voting on a question. The allowed answers are YES or NO, and the same member can vote only once per question.
 * Check the current amount of votes for each answer for a question and if it is already finished or not.
 
 Security of access are not being treated in this project.
